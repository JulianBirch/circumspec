# Circumspec: BDD in Clojure

Early days. Don't expect things to work or API to be stable. You've been warned.

## Usage

Run "lein compile" to compile circumspec.AssertFailed.

Read the features and tests directories. Run the scripts in script. Be brave.

The public API is the functions migrated into the circumspec namespace 
(see src/circumspec.clj)
